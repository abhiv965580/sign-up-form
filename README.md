# Description:

This Repo introduces the Sign up form of the Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS section. From this project I've implemented the use of forms and their action.

The screenshot of UI is attached in this Repo for reference

## Feature:

- The forms input fields are required such that It can't be submitted before filling them out correctly.
- Placeholder are placed such that It can give idea of filling it.
- Added Box shadow on the Form area so that it will be differentiated from other sections
- Added input box Focus property so that when it is selected it is highlighted with different color.
- The **Create Account** button does not collect any information for now.
